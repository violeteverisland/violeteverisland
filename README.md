While I am a student from HIT,it didn't appear to me too much knowledge or technology,which are the most precious things that I eager to get.   
So,I am learning code by myself,which is hard and low-efficiency.But I have no choice,make it ,or be made by it.There is no other choices.   
Wish I gain from the effort I've made and will make.Just fighting.
